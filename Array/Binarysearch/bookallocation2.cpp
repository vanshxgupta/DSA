// Ayush is studying for ninjatest which will be held after 'N' days, And to score good marks he has to study 'M' chapters and the ith chapter requires TIME[i] seconds to study. The day in Ayushâ€™s world has 100^100 seconds. There are some rules that are followed by Ayush while studying.

// 1. He reads the chapter in a sequential order, i.e. he studies i+1th chapter only after he studies ith chapter.

// 2. If he starts some chapter on a particular day he completes it that day itself.

// 3. He wants to distribute his workload over 'N' days, so he wants to minimize the maximum amount of time he studies in a day.

// Your task is to find out the minimal value of the maximum amount of time for which Ayush studies in a day, in order to complete all the 'M' chapters in no more than 'N' days.
